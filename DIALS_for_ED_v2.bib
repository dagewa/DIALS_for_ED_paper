  abstract = {The Crystallographic Binary File (CBF) is an electronic file supporting the efficient storage of large quantities of experimental data in a self-describing binary format. Its primary function is to handle large image data sets within laboratories and for interchange between collaborating groups. Except for embedded binary data segments, the format is derived from that of the pure-ASCII Crystallographic Information File (CIF), so that all suitable CIF data items describing the crystallographic experiment and description of any structural results may be included. Embedding of binary data fields makes use of Internet standard MIME headers to facilitate the identification and handling of separate binary components. Where file size or efficiency of processing are not important, the embedded binary data may be ASCII-encoded according to a specified protocol. The resultant file, containing only ASCII character data, is fully compatible with CIF and is known as an image-supporting crystallographic information file (imgCIF). This chapter describes in detail the structure and format of CBF and imgCIF representations, and explains how to convert from one format to the other. This chapter is also available as HTML from the International Tables Online site hosted by the IUCr.},

macromolecules currently resist structure elucidation by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography. Here, a single nanocrystal with a diffracting volume of only
0.14 microm3, i.e. no more than 6 x 105 unit cells, provided sufficient
information to determine the structure of a rare dimeric polymorph of hen
egg-white lysozyme by electron crystallography. This is at least an order of
magnitude smaller than was previously possible. The molecular-replacement
solution, based on a monomeric polyalanine model, provided sufficient phasing
power to show side-chain density, and automated model building was used to
reconstruct the side chains. Diffraction data were acquired using the rotation
method with parallel beam diffraction on a Titan Krios transmission electron
microscope equipped with a novel in-house-designed 1024 x 1024 pixel Timepix
hybrid pixel detector for low-dose diffraction data collection. Favourable
detector characteristics include the ability to accurately discriminate single
high-energy electrons from X-rays and count them, fast readout to finely sample
reciprocal space and a high dynamic range. This work, together with other recent
milestones, suggests that electron crystallography can provide an attractive
alternative in determining biological structures.},

In addition, diffraction images from crystals of several proteins, previously collected as part of in-house projects, were processed independently with three popular software packages. An analysis of the results, augmented by published serial crystallography data, suggests that the apparent precision of the presentation of unit-cell parameters in the PDB to three decimal points is not justified, since these parameters are subject to errors of not less than 0.2%. It was also noticed that processing data including full crystallographic symmetry does not lead to deterioration of the refinement parameters; thus, it is not beneficial to treat the crystals as belonging to space group {\it P}1 when higher symmetry can be seen.},

The significance of any anomalous signal may be assessed by probability and correlation analysis. The algorithms used by the {\it CCP}4 scaling program {\it SCALA} are described. A requirement for the scaling and merging of intensities is knowledge of the Laue group and point-group symmetries: the possible symmetry of the diffraction pattern may be determined from scores such as correlation coefficients between observations which might be symmetry-related.

A major limiting factor in X-ray crystallography is the requirement for large and well ordered crystals. By permitting electron diffraction patterns to be collected from much smaller crystals, or even single well ordered domains of large crystals composed of several small mosaic blocks, MicroED has the potential to overcome the limiting size requirement and enable structural studies on difficult-to-crystallize samples. This communication details the steps for sample preparation, data collection and reduction necessary to obtain refined, high-resolution, three-dimensional models by MicroED, and presents some of its unique challenges.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {The weak pixel counts surrounding the Bragg spots in a diffraction image are important for establishing a model of the background underneath the peak and estimating the reliability of the integrated intensities. Under certain circumstances, particularly with equipment not optimized for low-intensity measurements, these pixel values may be corrupted by corrections applied to the raw image. This can lead to truncation of low pixel counts, resulting in anomalies in the integrated Bragg intensities, such as systematically higher signal-to-noise ratios. A correction for this effect can be approximated by a three-parameter lognormal distribution fitted to the weakly positive-valued pixels at similar scattering angles. The procedure is validated by the improved refinement of an atomic model against structure factor amplitudes derived from corrected micro-electron diffraction (MicroED) images.},

abstract = {The refinement and validation of a crystallographic structure model is the last step before the coordinates and the associated data are submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The success of the refinement procedure is typically assessed by validating the models against geometrical criteria and the diffraction data, and is an important step in ensuring the quality of the PDB public archive [Read et al. (2011), Structure, 19, 1395-1412]. The PDB{\_}REDO procedure aims for `constructive validation', aspiring to consistent and optimal refinement parameterization and pro-active model rebuilding, not only correcting errors but striving for optimal interpretation of the electron density. A web server for PDB{\_}REDO has been implemented, allowing thorough, consistent and fully automated optimization of the refinement procedure in REFMAC and partial model rebuilding. The goal of the web server is to help practicing crystallographers to improve their model prior to submission to the PDB. For this, additional steps were implemented in the PDB{\_}REDO pipeline, both in the refinement procedure, e.g. testing of resolution limits and k-fold cross-validation for small test sets, and as new validation criteria, e.g. the density-fit metrics implemented in EDSTATS and ligand validation as implemented in YASARA. Innovative ways to present the refinement and validation results to the user are also described, which together with auto-generated Coot scripts can guide users to subsequent model inspection and improvement. It is demonstrated that using the server can lead to substantial improvement of structure models before they are submitted to the PDB.},

@article{Luebben2015,
abstract = {SignificanceModern crystallographic structure determination uses maximum likelihood methods. They rely on error estimates between the work model and the unknown target based on a small fraction of the data. This can introduce a large uncertainty and, even worse, restricts the method to projects where sufficient data are available. We investigate the Rcomplete method. It enables the use of all data for error estimation. It reduces the uncertainty associated with the conventional Rfree approach for small datasets. We show that our approach reduces the effect of overfitting. This enables maximum likelihood methods to be extended to a much wider field of applications, including free electron laser experiments, high-pressure crystallography, and low-resolution structures. The crystallographic reliability index Rcomplete is based on a method proposed more than two decades ago. Because its calculation is computationally expensive its use did not spread into the crystallographic community in favor of the cross-validation method known as Rfree. The importance of Rfree has grown beyond a pure validation tool. However, its application requires a sufficiently large dataset. In this work we assess the reliability of Rcomplete and we compare it with k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, and jackknifing. As opposed to proper cross-validation as realized with Rfree, Rcomplete relies on a method of reducing bias from the structural model. We compare two different methods reducing model bias and question the widely spread notion that random parameter shifts are required for this purpose. We show that Rcomplete has as little statistical bias as Rfree with the benefit of a much smaller variance. Because the calculation of Rcomplete is based on the entire dataset instead of a small subset, it allows the estimation of maximum likelihood parameters even for small datasets. Rcomplete enables maximum likelihood-based refinement to be extended to virtually all areas of crystallographic structure determination including high-pressure studies, neutron diffraction studies, and datasets from free electron lasers.},

abstract = {Phaser is a program for phasing macromolecular crystal structures by both molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods. The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.},

abstract = {This paper describes various components of the macromolecular crystallographic refinement program REFMAC5, which is distributed as part of the CCP4 suite. REFMAC5 utilizes different likelihood functions depending on the diffraction data employed (amplitudes or intensities), the presence of twinning and the availability of SAD/SIRAS experimental diffraction data. To ensure chemical and structural integrity of the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4 {\AA} can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of anisotropic ADPs.

  abstract = {When protein crystals are submicrometre-sized, X-ray radiation damage precludes conventional diffraction data collection. For crystals that are of the order of 100 nm in size, at best only single-shot diffraction patterns can be collected and rotation data collection has not been possible, irrespective of the diffraction technique used. Here, it is shown that at a very low electron dose (at most 0.1 e(-) {\AA}(-2)), a Medipix2 quantum area detector is sufficiently sensitive to allow the collection of a 30-frame rotation series of 200 keV electron-diffraction data from a single ∼100 nm thick protein crystal. A highly parallel 200 keV electron beam ($\lambda$ = 0.025 {\AA}) allowed observation of the curvature of the Ewald sphere at low resolution, indicating a combined mosaic spread/beam divergence of at most 0.4°. This result shows that volumes of crystal with low mosaicity can be pinpointed in electron diffraction. It is also shown that strategies and data-analysis software (MOSFLM and SCALA) from X-ray protein crystallography can be used in principle for analysing electron-diffraction data from three-dimensional nanocrystals of proteins.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for modelling the background for each Bragg reflection in a series of X-ray diffraction images containing Debye{\{}--{\}}Scherrer diffraction from ice in the sample is presented. The method involves the use of a global background model which is generated from the complete X-ray diffraction data set. Fitting of this model to the background pixels is then performed for each reflection independently. The algorithm uses a static background model that does not vary over the course of the scan. The greatest improvement can be expected for data where ice rings are present throughout the data set and the local background shape at the size of a spot on the detector does not exhibit large time-dependent variation. However, the algorithm has been applied to data sets whose background showed large pixel variations (variance/mean {\textgreater} 2) and has been shown to improve the results of processing for these data sets. It is shown that the use of a simple flat-background model as in traditional integration programs causes systematic bias in the background determination at ice-ring resolutions, resulting in an overestimation of reflection intensities at the peaks of the ice rings and an underestimation of reflection intensities either side of the ice ring. The new global background-model algorithm presented here corrects for this bias, resulting in a noticeable improvement in {\{}$\backslash$it R{\}} factors following refinement.},

abstract = {The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallographic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French {\&} Wilson (1978), Acta Cryst. A35, 517-525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.},

  abstract = {Procedures for detecting the point-group symmetry of macromolecular data sets are examined and enhancements are proposed. To validate a point group, it is sufficient to compare pairs of Bragg reflections that are related by each of the group's component symmetry operators. Correlation is commonly expressed in the form of a single statistical quantity (such as Rmerge) that incorporates information from all of the observed reflections. However, the usual practice of weighting all pairs of symmetry-related intensities equally can obscure the fact that the various symmetry operators of the point group contribute differing fractions of the total set. In some cases where particular symmetry elements are significantly under-represented, statistics calculated globally over all observations do not permit conclusions about the point group and Patterson symmetry. The problem can be avoided by repartitioning the data in a way that explicitly takes note of individual operators. The new analysis methods, incorporated into the program LABELIT (http://cci.lbl.gov/labelit), can be performed early enough during data acquisition, and are quick enough that it is feasible to pause to optimize the data collection strategy.},

Spatial distortions are divided into two types: gross distortions produced by the inherent properties of the detector components and local distortions formed by irregularities in the components. Intensity distortions are separated into three types: those caused by background nonuniformity; those resulting from pixel-dependent nonuniform intensity response; and those resulting from time-dependent variations in background and incident beam intensity. From background, flat-field, reference and mask images, `forward' and `reverse' interpolation tables are generated to correct for spatial distortions and a lookup table is generated to correct for nonuniform sensitivity. The routines have been used successfully on four different area detectors to correct entire images or to correct intensities of individual Bragg peaks. The spatial-distortion correction is good to within 0.1 pixels and the nonuniformity correction to [less-than 2%.},

Using this simulation, it has been shown how, and by how much, measurement errors are underestimated. A model of the detector statistics is presented and an adapted summation integration routine that takes this into account is shown to result in more realistic error estimates. In addition, the effect of correlations between pixels on two-dimensional profile fitting is demonstrated and the problems surrounding improvements to profile-fitting algorithms are discussed.

Therefore, much smaller ({\textless}1 microm) and thinner ({\textless}0.01 microm) protein crystals than those used for x-ray crystallography can be used to analyze the molecular structures by electron crystallography. But, inelastic scattering is a serious problem. We examined electron diffraction data from thin three-dimensional (3-D) crystals (600-750 A thick) and two-dimensional (2-D) crystals (approximately 60 A thick), both at 93 K, with an energy filtering electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Removal of inelastically scattered electrons significantly improved intensity data statistics and R(Friedel) factor in every resolution range up to 3-A resolution. The effect of energy filtering was more prominent for thicker crystals but was significant even for thin crystals. These filtered data sets showed better intensity statistics even in comparison with data sets collected at 4 K and an accelerating voltage of 300 kV without energy filtering. Thus, the energy filter will be an effective and important tool in the structure analysis of thin 3-D and 2-D crystals, particularly when data are collected at high tilt angle.},

Electron crystallography could provide a powerful means for structure determination with such undersized crystals, as protein atoms diffract electrons four to five orders of magnitude more strongly than they do X-rays. Furthermore, as electron crystallography yields Coulomb potential maps rather than electron density maps, it could provide a unique method to visualize the charged states of amino acid residues and metals. Here we describe an attempt to develop a methodology for electron crystallography of ultrathin (only a few layers thick) 3D protein crystals and present the Coulomb potential maps at 3.4-{\AA} and 3.2-{\AA} resolution, respectively, obtained from Ca(2+)-ATPase and catalase crystals.

@article{Shi2016,
abstract = {The formation of large, well-ordered crystals for crystallographic experiments remains a crucial bottleneck to the structural understanding of many important biological systems. To help alleviate this problem in crystallography, we have developed the MicroED method for the collection of electron diffraction data from 3D microcrystals and nanocrystals of radiation-sensitive biological material. In this approach, liquid solutions containing protein microcrystals are deposited on carbon-coated electron microscopy grids and are vitrified by plunging them into liquid ethane. MicroED data are collected for each selected crystal using cryo-electron microscopy, in which the crystal is diffracted using very few electrons as the stage is continuously rotated. This protocol gives advice on how to identify microcrystals by light microscopy or by negative-stain electron microscopy in samples obtained from standard protein crystallization experiments. The protocol also includes information about custom-designed equipment for controlling crystal rotation and software for recording experimental parameters in diffraction image metadata. Identifying microcrystals, preparing samples and setting up the microscope for diffraction data collection take approximately half an hour for each step. Screening microcrystals for quality diffraction takes roughly an hour, and the collection of a single data set is ∼10 min in duration. Complete data sets and resulting high-resolution structures can be obtained from a single crystal or by merging data from multiple crystals.},

@article{Wan2013,
  abstract = {Implementation of a computer program package for automated collection and processing of rotation electron diffraction (RED) data is described. The software package contains two computer programs: RED data collection and RED data processing. The RED data collection program controls the transmission electron microscope and the camera. Electron beam tilts at a fine step (0.05-0.20°) are combined with goniometer tilts at a coarse step (2.0-3.0°) around a common tilt axis, which allows a fine relative tilt to be achieved between the electron beam and the crystal in a large tilt range. An electron diffraction (ED) frame is collected at each combination of beam tilt and goniometer tilt. The RED data processing program processes three-dimensional ED data generated by the RED data collection program or by other approaches. It includes shift correction of the ED frames, peak hunting for diffraction spots in individual ED frames and identification of these diffraction spots as reflections in three dimensions. Unit-cell parameters are determined from the positions of reflections in three-dimensional reciprocal space. All reflections are indexed, and finally a list with hkl indices and intensities is output. The data processing program also includes a visualizer to view and analyse three-dimensional reciprocal lattices reconstructed from the ED frames. Details of the implementation are described. Data collection and data processing with the software RED are demonstrated using a calcined zeolite sample, silicalite-1. The structure of the calcined silicalite-1, with 72 unique atoms, could be solved from the RED data by routine direct methods.},

@article{Weirich2000,
abstract = { The structure of a new modification of Ti2Se, the beta-phase, and several related inorganic crystal structures containing elements with atomic numbers between 16 and 40 have been solved by quasi-automatic direct methods from single-crystal electron diffraction patterns of nanometre-size crystals, using the kinematical aproxi-mation. The crystals were several thousand times smaller than the minimum size required for single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Atomic coordinates were found with an average accuracy of 0.2 A or better. Experimental data were obtained by standardized techniques for recording and quantifying electron diffraction patterns. The SIR97 program for solving crystal structures from three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data by direct methods was modified to work also with two-dimensional electron diffraction data. },
