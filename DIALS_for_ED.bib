  abstract = {The Crystallographic Binary File (CBF) is an electronic file supporting the efficient storage of large quantities of experimental data in a self-describing binary format. Its primary function is to handle large image data sets within laboratories and for interchange between collaborating groups. Except for embedded binary data segments, the format is derived from that of the pure-ASCII Crystallographic Information File (CIF), so that all suitable CIF data items describing the crystallographic experiment and description of any structural results may be included. Embedding of binary data fields makes use of Internet standard MIME headers to facilitate the identification and handling of separate binary components. Where file size or efficiency of processing are not important, the embedded binary data may be ASCII-encoded according to a specified protocol. The resultant file, containing only ASCII character data, is fully compatible with CIF and is known as an image-supporting crystallographic information file (imgCIF). This chapter describes in detail the structure and format of CBF and imgCIF representations, and explains how to convert from one format to the other. This chapter is also available as HTML from the International Tables Online site hosted by the IUCr.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional nanometre-sized crystals of
macromolecules currently resist structure elucidation by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography. Here, a single nanocrystal with a diffracting volume of only
0.14 microm3, i.e. no more than 6 x 105 unit cells, provided sufficient
information to determine the structure of a rare dimeric polymorph of hen
egg-white lysozyme by electron crystallography. This is at least an order of
magnitude smaller than was previously possible. The molecular-replacement
solution, based on a monomeric polyalanine model, provided sufficient phasing
power to show side-chain density, and automated model building was used to
reconstruct the side chains. Diffraction data were acquired using the rotation
method with parallel beam diffraction on a Titan Krios transmission electron
microscope equipped with a novel in-house-designed 1024 x 1024 pixel Timepix
hybrid pixel detector for low-dose diffraction data collection. Favourable
detector characteristics include the ability to accurately discriminate single
high-energy electrons from X-rays and count them, fast readout to finely sample
reciprocal space and a high dynamic range. This work, together with other recent
milestones, suggests that electron crystallography can provide an attractive
alternative in determining biological structures.},

In addition, diffraction images from crystals of several proteins, previously collected as part of in-house projects, were processed independently with three popular software packages. An analysis of the results, augmented by published serial crystallography data, suggests that the apparent precision of the presentation of unit-cell parameters in the PDB to three decimal points is not justified, since these parameters are subject to errors of not less than 0.2%. It was also noticed that processing data including full crystallographic symmetry does not lead to deterioration of the refinement parameters; thus, it is not beneficial to treat the crystals as belonging to space group {\it P}1 when higher symmetry can be seen.},

A major limiting factor in X-ray crystallography is the requirement for large and well ordered crystals. By permitting electron diffraction patterns to be collected from much smaller crystals, or even single well ordered domains of large crystals composed of several small mosaic blocks, MicroED has the potential to overcome the limiting size requirement and enable structural studies on difficult-to-crystallize samples. This communication details the steps for sample preparation, data collection and reduction necessary to obtain refined, high-resolution, three-dimensional models by MicroED, and presents some of its unique challenges.},

  abstract = {The weak pixel counts surrounding the Bragg spots in a diffraction image are important for establishing a model of the background underneath the peak and estimating the reliability of the integrated intensities. Under certain circumstances, particularly with equipment not optimized for low-intensity measurements, these pixel values may be corrupted by corrections applied to the raw image. This can lead to truncation of low pixel counts, resulting in anomalies in the integrated Bragg intensities, such as systematically higher signal-to-noise ratios. A correction for this effect can be approximated by a three-parameter lognormal distribution fitted to the weakly positive-valued pixels at similar scattering angles. The procedure is validated by the improved refinement of an atomic model against structure factor amplitudes derived from corrected micro-electron diffraction (MicroED) images.},

For crystals that are of the order of 100 nm in size, at best only single-shot diffraction patterns can be collected and rotation data collection has not been possible, irrespective of the diffraction technique used. Here, it is shown that at a very low electron dose (at most 0.1 e(-) {\AA}(-2)), a Medipix2 quantum area detector is sufficiently sensitive to allow the collection of a 30-frame rotation series of 200 keV electron-diffraction data from a single ∼100 nm thick protein crystal. A highly parallel 200 keV electron beam ($\lambda$ = 0.025 {\AA}) allowed observation of the curvature of the Ewald sphere at low resolution, indicating a combined mosaic spread/beam divergence of at most 0.4°. This result shows that volumes of crystal with low mosaicity can be pinpointed in electron diffraction. It is also shown that strategies and data-analysis software (MOSFLM and SCALA) from X-ray protein crystallography can be used in principle for analysing electron-diffraction data from three-dimensional nanocrystals of proteins.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for modelling the background for each Bragg reflection in a series of X-ray diffraction images containing Debye{\{}--{\}}Scherrer diffraction from ice in the sample is presented. The method involves the use of a global background model which is generated from the complete X-ray diffraction data set. Fitting of this model to the background pixels is then performed for each reflection independently. The algorithm uses a static background model that does not vary over the course of the scan. The greatest improvement can be expected for data where ice rings are present throughout the data set and the local background shape at the size of a spot on the detector does not exhibit large time-dependent variation. However, the algorithm has been applied to data sets whose background showed large pixel variations (variance/mean {\textgreater} 2) and has been shown to improve the results of processing for these data sets. It is shown that the use of a simple flat-background model as in traditional integration programs causes systematic bias in the background determination at ice-ring resolutions, resulting in an overestimation of reflection intensities at the peaks of the ice rings and an underestimation of reflection intensities either side of the ice ring. The new global background-model algorithm presented here corrects for this bias, resulting in a noticeable improvement in {\{}$\backslash$it R{\}} factors following refinement.},

  abstract = {Procedures for detecting the point-group symmetry of macromolecular data sets are examined and enhancements are proposed. To validate a point group, it is sufficient to compare pairs of Bragg reflections that are related by each of the group's component symmetry operators. Correlation is commonly expressed in the form of a single statistical quantity (such as Rmerge) that incorporates information from all of the observed reflections. However, the usual practice of weighting all pairs of symmetry-related intensities equally can obscure the fact that the various symmetry operators of the point group contribute differing fractions of the total set. In some cases where particular symmetry elements are significantly under-represented, statistics calculated globally over all observations do not permit conclusions about the point group and Patterson symmetry. The problem can be avoided by repartitioning the data in a way that explicitly takes note of individual operators. The new analysis methods, incorporated into the program LABELIT (http://cci.lbl.gov/labelit), can be performed early enough during data acquisition, and are quick enough that it is feasible to pause to optimize the data collection strategy.},

A large Fourier term will be found that has a periodicity corresponding to the interplanar distance if the chosen direction happens to be perpendicular to a set of widely separated reciprocal-lattice planes. Exploration of such directions over a hemisphere establishes the best potential basis vectors of the real cell. The program has successfully determined the lengths and directions of basis vectors for numerous unit cells having cell dimensions ranging from 16 to 668{\AA} and oscillation ranges from 0.2 to 2.0{$^\circ$}.},

  abstract = {Until recently, structure determination by transmission electron microscopy of beam-sensitive three-dimensional nanocrystals required electron diffraction tomography data collection at liquid-nitrogen temperature, in order to reduce radiation damage. Here it is shown that the novel Timepix detector combines a high dynamic range with a very high signal-to-noise ratio and single-electron sensitivity, enabling ab initio phasing of beam-sensitive organic compounds. Low-dose electron diffraction data (∼0.013 e(-) {\AA}(-2) s(-1)) were collected at room temperature with the rotation method. It was ascertained that the data were of sufficient quality for structure solution using direct methods using software developed for X-ray crystallography (XDS, SHELX) and for electron crystallography (ADT3D/PETS, SIR2014).},

In an attempt to understand fully and identify correctly the sources of all contributions to these errors, a simulation of a CCD-based area-detector module has been produced to address the problem of correct handling of data from such detectors. Using this simulation, it has been shown how, and by how much, measurement errors are underestimated. A model of the detector statistics is presented and an adapted summation integration routine that takes this into account is shown to result in more realistic error estimates. In addition, the effect of correlations between pixels on two-dimensional profile fitting is demonstrated and the problems surrounding improvements to profile-fitting algorithms are discussed. In practice, this requires knowledge of the expected correlation between pixels in the image.},

  abstract = {Membrane proteins and macromolecular complexes often yield crystals too small or too thin for even the modern synchrotron X-ray beam. Electron crystallography could provide a powerful means for structure determination with such undersized crystals, as protein atoms diffract electrons four to five orders of magnitude more strongly than they do X-rays. Furthermore, as electron crystallography yields Coulomb potential maps rather than electron density maps, it could provide a unique method to visualize the charged states of amino acid residues and metals. Here we describe an attempt to develop a methodology for electron crystallography of ultrathin (only a few layers thick) 3D protein crystals and present the Coulomb potential maps at 3.4-{\AA} and 3.2-{\AA} resolution, respectively, obtained from Ca(2+)-ATPase and catalase crystals. These maps demonstrate that it is indeed possible to build atomic models from such crystals and even to determine the charged states of amino acid residues in the Ca(2+)-binding sites of Ca(2+)-ATPase and that of the iron atom in the heme in catalase.},

abstract = {The formation of large, well-ordered crystals for crystallographic experiments remains a crucial bottleneck to the structural understanding of many important biological systems. To help alleviate this problem in crystallography, we have developed the MicroED method for the collection of electron diffraction data from 3D microcrystals and nanocrystals of radiation-sensitive biological material. In this approach, liquid solutions containing protein microcrystals are deposited on carbon-coated electron microscopy grids and are vitrified by plunging them into liquid ethane. MicroED data are collected for each selected crystal using cryo-electron microscopy, in which the crystal is diffracted using very few electrons as the stage is continuously rotated. This protocol gives advice on how to identify microcrystals by light microscopy or by negative-stain electron microscopy in samples obtained from standard protein crystallization experiments. The protocol also includes information about custom-designed equipment for controlling crystal rotation and software for recording experimental parameters in diffraction image metadata. Identifying microcrystals, preparing samples and setting up the microscope for diffraction data collection take approximately half an hour for each step. Screening microcrystals for quality diffraction takes roughly an hour, and the collection of a single data set is ∼10 min in duration. Complete data sets and resulting high-resolution structures can be obtained from a single crystal or by merging data from multiple crystals.},

  abstract = {Implementation of a computer program package for automated collection and processing of rotation electron diffraction (RED) data is described. The software package contains two computer programs: RED data collection and RED data processing. The RED data collection program controls the transmission electron microscope and the camera. Electron beam tilts at a fine step (0.05-0.20°) are combined with goniometer tilts at a coarse step (2.0-3.0°) around a common tilt axis, which allows a fine relative tilt to be achieved between the electron beam and the crystal in a large tilt range. An electron diffraction (ED) frame is collected at each combination of beam tilt and goniometer tilt. The RED data processing program processes three-dimensional ED data generated by the RED data collection program or by other approaches. It includes shift correction of the ED frames, peak hunting for diffraction spots in individual ED frames and identification of these diffraction spots as reflections in three dimensions. Unit-cell parameters are determined from the positions of reflections in three-dimensional reciprocal space. All reflections are indexed, and finally a list with hkl indices and intensities is output. The data processing program also includes a visualizer to view and analyse three-dimensional reciprocal lattices reconstructed from the ED frames. Details of the implementation are described. Data collection and data processing with the software RED are demonstrated using a calcined zeolite sample, silicalite-1. The structure of the calcined silicalite-1, with 72 unique atoms, could be solved from the RED data by routine direct methods.},
